run-convert-tests.py -- check convert.py, the driver, on the fixtures.

    python3 tests/run-convert-tests.py

Needs Pandoc 3.9 or later. Each case is a directory of the fixture
documents with a configuration, run through convert.py, and read back:
that a bare directory converts beside the sources as it always has, that
several targets each land in their own directory, that two targets whose
filter settings agree share one intermediate and two whose settings
differ do not, that a target away from the sources gets its media, and
that the reports are written once per book.
